## SASS

We're using sass as our css styling engine. To get it working on your machine install it [**here**](http://sass-lang.com/install).

After that, it's as easy as running:

`sass --watch src/sass/main:src/css`

from the main project directory to start compiling your sass into CSS.

**Do not edit any files inside the CSS folder, they will be overwritten during the next sass compile**
